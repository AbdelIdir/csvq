# Row Value

A Row Value is a ordered list of values.

```sql
row_value
  : (value [, value...])
  | (select_query)
```

_value_
: [value]({{ '/reference/value.html' | relative_url }})

_select_query_
: [Select Query]({{ '/reference/select-query.html' | relative_url }})
  
  Retrieved fields of _select_query_ are used as listed values.
  The result set of _select_query_ must be at most one record.


Row Values can be used in limited operation such as [Comparison Operation]({{ '/reference/comparison-operators.html' | relative_url }}) or [Insert Query]({{ '/reference/insert-query.html' | relative_url }}).
In most cases, a row value with a single value is interpreted as a value with parentheses.
